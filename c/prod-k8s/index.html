<p>2021 has been a year. Due to several professional and personal things, I
haven't been as active writing, teaching, and recording videos as I'd like. In
fact, this will be my <strong>only</strong> new content for 2021. However, this is a <strong>big</strong>
piece of content! I'm ecstatic to be writing about (albeit late) my book
Production Kubernetes!</p>

<p>This book was written alongside my co-workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228170940/https://twitter.com/johnharris85">John
Harris</a>, Rich Lander, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228170940/https://twitter.com/alexbrand">Alex
Brand</a>. I've worked with these humans
architecting, engineering, and deploying Kubernetes at scale since ~<code>Kubernetes 1.2</code>. We also worked together at some key Kubernetes shops such as
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228170940/https://thenewstack.io/say-goodbye-to-coreos/">CoreOS</a> and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228170940/https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/vmware-acquires-heptio-the-startup-founded-by-2-co-founders-of-kubernetes/">Heptio</a>
until we eventually found ourselves at VMware. This book encapsulates many of
our learnings over the years and takes you on a journey describing how we
navigate cloud-native technologies. An interesting aspect of this book is that
it is <strong>not a how-to book</strong>. We took the stance early on that existing
documentation suffices in teaching you how to do things in Kubernetes. This book
focuses on the what and why. It is about decisions and trade-offs, which we feel
is the real crux of doing Kubernetes in production.</p>
