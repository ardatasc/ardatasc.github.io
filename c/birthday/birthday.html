<p>The birthday problem (or birthday paradox) is a classic question in probability. It asks: in a group of people, what is the probability that at least two individuals share the same birthday? Surprisingly, the probability reaches 50% with just 23 people in the group. Back when I was first learning python, I thought it would be a good exercise to implement a simulation of the birthday problem. Here's what I did.</p>

<h2 id='explanation'>Explanation</h2>
<p>
  Used directly, the naive definition says we just need to count the number of ways to assign birthdays to  people such that there are two or more people who share a birthday.
  But this counting problem is hard, since it could be Emma and Steve who share a birthday, or Steve and Naomi, or all three of them, or the three of them could share a birthday while two others in the group share a different birthday,
  or various other possibilities.
  <b>Instead, we may find that taking the complement may be easier</b>. Let’s denote:<br><br>
  \( n \) as the number of people in the room,
  \( P(\text{no match}) \): the probability that all \( n \) people have unique birthdays, and
  \( P(\text{at least one match}) \): the probability that at least two people share a birthday. <br>

  We start by calculating \( P(\text{no match}) \) and then use it to find \( P(\text{at least one match}) \).
</p>
<h3 id='math'>Calculating \( P(\text{no match}) \) </h3>


<p>Let's count how many ways we can assign birthdays to \( k \) people such that no two people share a birthday. The number of possibilities can be expresseed as:</p>
<br><br>

\[
P(\text{no match}) = \frac{365 \cdot 364 ...(365 - k +1)}{365^k} \text{  or  } \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} ( 1 - \frac{k}{365})
\], and the complement (at least one match) is:

\[
P(\text{at least one match}) = 1 - \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (1 - \frac{k}{365})
\]

This is sort of a cumbersome calculation. Luckily, we can estimate the Probability of not matching for small \( k \) as the Taylor approximation of \( e^{-x} \) \( \approx e^\frac{-k}{365} \).
This allows us to convert our product into a sum.

\[
P(\text{no match}) = e^{-\frac{1}{365} \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k} \implies e^{-\frac{(n-1)n}{2 \cdot 365}}
\]
\[
\therefore P(\text{match}) = 1 - e^{-\frac{(n-1)n}{2 \cdot 365}}
\]

<br><br>


Surprisingly, at around \( k = 23 \) people we find that our probability of success becomes about \( \approx 0.5 \). We can verify this by actually simulating the situation in python.

<h2 id="code" >Code</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
import random

def birthdaymatch():
    birthdays = set()
    count = 0
    for i in range(367):
        birthday = random.randint(1, 365)
        count += 1
        if birthday in birthdays:
            return count
        birthdays.add(birthday)

results = [birthdaymatch() for _ in range(100)]
print('Average number of people until match:', sum(results) / len(results))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Average amount of people until match: 23.64
</code></pre>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>When you run this simulation, you should find that the average number of people required to find a shared birthday is close to 23, confirming the mathematical result.

The birthday problem is a great example of how probability can challenge our intuition, and it’s also a fun way to explore simulations in Python. If you’d like to try running the code, experiment with different numbers of simulations and group sizes to see how the probability behaves.</p>
