<p>This post explores multiple ways network policy can be expressed in Kubernetes.
This includes the native API and CNI-plugin specific Custom Resource Definitions
(CRD). By understanding these different approaches, you will be able to make an
informed decision around what is best for your environment!</p>
<p>Enforcing network policy in a Kubernetes cluster is a common pattern. By
enforcing rules with the same technology facilitating the pod network, you can
achieve granular levels of segmentation. It also enables you to use constructs
familiar to Kubernetes. For example, allowing traffic based on
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels">labels</a>.
Kubernetes provides
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/">NetworkPolicy</a>
as a first class API. If you have a Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugin
that supports it, these rules are enforced. However, the standard Kubernetes
<code>NetworkPolicy</code> API can be limiting. This is why providers such as
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://www.projectcalico.org/">Calico</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://cilium.io/">Cilium</a> offer
their own network policy CRDs.</p>

<h2 id="kubernetes-networkpolicy">Kubernetes NetworkPolicy</h2>
<p><code>NetworkPolicy</code> objects can be added to any Kubernetes cluster. In order for
these policies to be enforced, your cluster must run a CNI plugin that respects
these policies. Common CNI plugins with this support are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://cilium.io/">Cilium</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://www.projectcalico.org/">Calico</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://www.weave.works/">Weave</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://github.com/projectcalico/canal">Canal</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By default, Kubernetes clusters do not restrict traffic. Pods can communicate
with any other pods. External clients can also communicate with pods, assuming
they have a way to route to the cluster's virtual IPs (VIP).</p>
<p><code>NetworkPolicy</code> is namespace scoped. Rules defined in the policy allow traffic
and are combined additively. This raises the following question. If Kubernetes
allows all traffic and added rules are only for allowing traffic, how would you
<strong>restrict</strong> traffic?</p>
<p>When a <code>NetworkPolicy</code> object is introduced to a namespace, all traffic not
explicitly allowed becomes denied. This new implicit deny-all (minus what rules
you created) applies to everything satisfying the <code>spec.podSelector</code>. This
behavioral change trips up many newcomers of <code>NetworkPolicy</code>.</p>
<p>A namespace-wide policy can be created by setting the <code>podSelector</code> value to
<code>{}</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the following manifest that allows <code>pod-a</code> to receive traffic from
<code>pod-b</code> and egress to it. It is a <strong>namespace-wide</strong> policy due to the
<code>spec.podSelector</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: team-netpol
  namespace: org-1
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  # allow all inbound traffic on port 80
  - from:
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  egress:
  # allow DNS traffic
  - to:
    ports:
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: org-2
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: team-b
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
</code></pre><p>Traffic is allowed from <code>team-a</code> to <code>team-b</code>. Traffic is also accepted by
<code>team-a</code> when trying to reach it on port 80.</p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netpol-s-1.png" target="octetz-img">
<img class="center" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001im_/https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netpol-s-1.png">
</a>
<p>The above demonstrates the impact this policy has on the cluster. Since <code>team-a</code>
accepts all ingress on port <code>80</code>, <code>team-b</code> can egress to it. <code>team-a</code> is also
enabled to egress to <code>team-b</code>. However, should <code>team-a</code> want to reach
<code>google.com</code>, it will be blocked due to the fact that it is <strong>not</strong> explicitly
allowed. <code>team-b</code> on the other hand can reach <code>google.com</code> as there is no
<code>NetworkPolicy</code> present in the <code>org-2</code> namespace.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you were to move <code>team-b</code> into the same namespace as <code>team-a</code>,
<code>team-b</code> would no longer be able to send traffic to <code>team-a</code>.</p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netpol-s-2.png" target="octetz-img">
<img class="center" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001im_/https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netpol-s-2.png">
</a>
<p>Now that <code>team-b</code> is part of the <code>org-1</code> namespace, it is beholden to the
implicit deny brought on by the policy. It can no longer accept ingress and its
egress capabilities are limited to itself. These are the side-effects one should
expect when implementing namespace-wide policies (via <code>spec.podSelecter: {}</code>).</p>
<p>To limit the impact of a policy, the <code>spec.podSelector</code> can be set to <code>team-a</code>,
re-opening all ingress and egress traffic for pods without the label <code>app: team-a</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: team-netpol
  namespace: org-1
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: team-a
</code></pre>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netpol-s-3.png" target="octetz-img">
<img class="center" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001im_/https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netpol-s-3.png">
</a>
<p>Now the implicit denial rules are scoped to <code>team-a</code>. <code>team-b</code> (and pods without
the label <code>app: team-a</code>) can accept ingress and create egress traffic freely.</p>
<p>As we have seen, there is flexibility to create workload-specific policies and
namespace-wide policies. Your choice depends on the workloads and how you
administer your namespaces. An example of a blanket policy that restricts all
ingress traffic to pods in a namespace but does not restrict egress is as
follows.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all-ingress
  namespace: org-1
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
</code></pre><p>This is a common pattern that allows application teams to open ingress access as
they see fit. Some clusters are setup to provision namespaces with an initial
policy such as the above on namespace create. Achieving this requires extra
engineering work.</p>
<p><code>NetworkPolicy</code> has more features not highlighted here. Visit the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies">NetworkPolicy</a>
documentation for examples.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Over time, <code>NetworkPolicy</code> has become more feature rich. For example,
traditionally it only supported ingress rules. It also did not allow for
specifying IP CIDRs in rules. CNI plugins, such as Calico, have proven out these
capabilities and brought enhancements upstream. However, there are still
limitations you may care about.</p>
<p>A list of common limitations are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>No explicit deny rules.</li>
<li>Lacking support for advanced expressions on selectors.</li>
<li>No layer 7 rules.
<ul>
<li>No limiting certain HTTP methods, paths, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No cluster-wide policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these limitations, CNI plugins such as Calico and Cilium offer their
own network policy CRDs.</p>
<p>A limitation I have found most interesting is the lack of cluster-wide policy in
the native API. This ask is rooted in a desire to achieve micro-segmentation
across workloads via one source of truth (manifest). In the next section, you'll
see an example of this and the Calico CRDs.</p>
<h2 id="networkpolicy-crds">NetworkPolicy CRDs</h2>
<p>Calico offers a <code>NetworkPolicy</code> CRD and a <code>GlobalNetworkPolicy</code> CRD. These CRDs
are applied using <code>calicoctl</code>. Depending on your Calico deployment, they are
written to <code>kube-apiserver</code> or an etcd. The <code>NetworkPolicy</code> CRD is namespace
scoped like the Kubernetes <code>NetworkPolicy</code> API. It includes a larger feature set
such as the deny rules, levels of rule resolution, L7 rules, and more. The
<code>GlobalNetworkPolicy</code> CRD is similar but is cluster-scoped. A rule applied in
this CRD impacts every pod that satisfies its selector(s).</p>
<p>The upcoming example applies a &quot;default-deny-all&quot; policy to the cluster. It will
make an exception for <code>kube-system</code> by allowing all traffic to any namespace
with the label <code>name: kube-system</code>. Namespaces do not have this label by
default. The following command will add it.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>kubectl label namespaces kube-system name=kube-system
</code></pre><p>Assume you want to deny traffic for pods in non-system namespaces by default.
Teams can add their own namespace-scoped policies to allow routes. Achieving
&quot;micro-segmentation&quot;. This is a great use case for <code>GlobalNetworkPolicy</code>.
Consider the following CRD.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># This GlobalNetworkPolicy uses Calico&#39;s CRD
# (https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.5/reference/calicoctl/resources/globalnetworkpolicy)

metadata:
  name: global-deny-all
spec:
  # order controls the precedence. Calico applies the policy with the lowest value first.
  # Kubernetes NetworkPolicy does not support order. They are automatically converted to an order
  # value of 1000 by Calico. Setting this value to 2000, provides flexibility for 999 additional
  # GlobalNetworkPolicies to be added and ensures Kubernetes namespace-scoped policies always take
  # precedence.
  order: 2000
  types:
  - Ingress
  - Egress

  # egress network rules
  egress:
  # Allow all egress traffic from kube-system.
  - action: Allow
    destination: {}
    source:
      namespaceSelector: name == &#39;kube-system&#39;

  # Allow egress DNS traffic to any destination.
  - action: Allow
    protocol: UDP
    destination:
      nets:
        - 0.0.0.0/0
      ports:
        - 53

  # ingress network rules
  ingress:
  # Allow all ingress traffic for the kube-system namespace.
  - action: Allow
    destination:
      namespaceSelector: name == &#39;kube-system&#39;
    source: {}
</code></pre><p>Applying the above policy can be applied as follows.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>DATASTORE_TYPE=kubernetes \
    KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
    calicoctl apply -f global-deny-all.yaml
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><code>calicoctl</code> is available for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://github.com/projectcalico/calicoctl/releases">download on

<p>As seen above, this would block all egress and ingress traffic in namespaces
outside of <code>kube-system</code>. With the exception of DNS traffic (<code>UDP:53</code>). This one
manifest has cluster-wide control. However, teams can still apply Kubernetes
<code>NetworkPolicy</code> on top of that to &quot;poke holes&quot; for their egress and ingress
needs. For example, if you wanted to open all egress traffic to <code>pod-a</code> in the
<code>org-1</code> namespace, the following Kubernetes <code>NetworkPolicy</code> could be applied to
the <code>org-1</code> namespace.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: team-netpol
  namespace: org-1
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: team-a
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
</code></pre>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001/https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/global-netpol-s-2.png" target="octetz-img">
<img class="center" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208150001im_/https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/global-netpol-s-2.png">
</a>
<p>Now the <code>team-a</code> pod can egress to <code>google.com</code>. It can also egress to <code>team-b</code>,
but due to the <code>GlobalNetworkPolicy</code>, <code>team-b</code> is not accepting ingress traffic.
To resolve this, an allow rule for ingress would need to be added to the <code>org-2</code>
namespace.</p>
<p>This example can also be achieved if every team's namespace has a Kubernetes
<code>NetworkPolicy</code> that blocks all traffic by default. This does have trade-offs
though. Not only are those <code>NetworkPolicy</code> objects less flexible, you now have
<em>N</em> locations you need to update if you wish to change things about your
&quot;default-deny&quot; rule.</p>

<h2 id="which-should-i-use">Which Should I Use?</h2>
<p>It depends. It could be both! The upside to using Kubernetes-native
<code>NetworkPolicy</code> is it is agnostic to your CNI plugin, making the definitions
portable across plugins. Policies defined in the cluster <em>should</em> act the same
in Weave, Cilium, Calico, and more. However, if some advanced features are
important to you, you may consider using a plugin-specific CRD. Should you
choose to change CNI plugins in the future, you may find yourself re-writing
network rules.</p>
<p>I personally see value in the global (cluster-wide) policies offered by Calico.
Thus I prefer to mix both CNI plugin-specific CRDs with Kubernetes-native
<code>NetworkPolicy</code>. For example, cluster administrators can create
<code>GlobalNetworkPolicies</code> defining a set of <code>cluster-wide</code> truths about how
networking works. Teams using the cluster create their own namespace-scoped
<code>NetworkPolicy</code> using the Kubernetes-native <code>NetworkPolicy</code>. Your ability to
take this approach depends on your CNI plugin. For example, Calico supports
mixing their CRDs and Kubernetes <code>NetworkPolicy</code>. However, Cilium recommends you
choose one or the other, based on their docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is recommended to only use one of the above policy types [Kubernetes vs
Cilium CRD] at a time to minimize unintended effects arising from the
interaction between the policies.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I hope this post sheds light on the capabilities of the Kubernetes
<code>NetworkPolicy</code> API and enhancements available through CNI plugin-specific CRDs.
