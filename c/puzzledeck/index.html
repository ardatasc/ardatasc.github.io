<p>Recently, I recieved a cool card deck and a t-shirt of questionable quality from a guest speaker at Columbia. Upon further inspection yesterday I realized that there was an extraneous card that held a cryptic clue:</p>
<img src="IMG_3240.jpg" object-fit: width: 25% height:25%></img>

<p> The deck itself is a standard 52 cards; The intruiging parts are that:
  <ul>
    <li>Each card has has a compass on its back showing North.</li>
    <li>The face cards all hold different clues: the Jacks hold different card addresses in their hands.</li>
    <li>Each King holds 1-4 swords.</li>
    <li>Some cards have hollow pips.</li>
    <li><b>The clue card states that 'final word comes from the Queen'.</b></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Most of the challenge from this puzzle was due to the open-ended nature of the 'leads'. The wording of the clue card played a big part in finding the solution.
  <br><br>My first attempt was to organize the cards into a series of sequences denoted by the Jacks and ordered by the Kings. This didn't lead anywhere, except for the next step, which was using all of the other hollow-pip cards to fill the sequences. After this step, I was kind of stuck but re-reading the clue card gave me the information I needed: specifically, in the form of the word trace and the phrase "pointedly implanted". That hinted towards some sort of geometric pattern so I started looking for polygonal patterns.
</p>

<p>Observe the hollow pips at each column. If you were to draw a line between each hollow pip in the column in descending order, you would find the letters:
<b> Z, L, C, L, Z, Y, O, I, I, A[CE], Q[UEEN].</b> The last two were simple guesses based on the clue card if I'm being honest.</p>
<br><br>
<p>At this penultimate step, I figured out the actual use of the Jacks. They denoted the order of the letters.</p>
<p>A quick python script for style points:</p>

<p>There you have it! I also think the t-shirt is a puzzle but I haven't had the time to take a look at it.</p>
